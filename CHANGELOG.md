All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-15

### Added
-   **Initial Project Setup**: Configured project with Electron, React, and TypeScript using Electron Forge and Webpack.
-   **Canvas Rendering**: Implemented a 640x640 canvas to display a background image.
-   **Word Input**: Added a text input field to accept new words and add them to a state-managed list.
-   **Word Cloud Drawing**: Words from the list are now drawn onto the canvas.
-   **Dynamic Font Sizing**: Implemented logic to scale word font size based on their order in the priority list. The highest word is the largest.
-   **Clickable Words**: Words on the canvas are now interactive; clicking a word opens a Google search for it in the user's default browser.
-   **Automatic Placement**: New words are automatically placed in a random position that avoids the center of the canvas, creating a "cloud" effect.
-   **Reorderable Priority List**: Implemented a priority list with clickable arrows, allowing users to reorder words and dynamically update their size on the canvas.
-   **Advanced Task Manager**: Transformed the simple word list into a detailed task manager with fields for URL, Priority, Company, Due Dates, Image Links, and a rich-text Description.
-   **Tabbed Ticket View**: Implemented a tabbed interface within each task to separate the read-only "Ticket" display from the "Edit" form, preventing accidental edits.
-   **Rich Text Editing**: Added WYSIWYG support to description fields, including keyboard shortcuts for Bold (`Ctrl+B`), Italic (`Ctrl+I`), Underline (`Ctrl+U`), Link (`Ctrl+K`), and List (`Ctrl+L`).
-   **Task Actions**: Added a context menu and buttons for completing, reopening, copying, and deleting tasks.
-   **Advanced Rich Text Shortcuts**: Added shortcuts for `H1-H6` headers (`Alt+1-6`), Paragraphs (`Ctrl+P`), and clearing format (`Ctrl+\`).
-   **Sub-Category System**: Implemented a full sub-category system, allowing for two-level task organization. This includes management in the sidebar, grouped dropdowns in forms, and a two-tier filtering system in the "List View" with accurate task counts.
-   **Granular Date/Time Control**: Replaced date-only pickers with `datetime-local` inputs for "Open Date" and "Complete By". Added "NOW", "Clear", "Round to Hour" (`:00`), and incremental time adjustment buttons (`+/- 15m, 1h, 1d`, etc.) for rapid deadline and start-time setting.
-   **Window State Persistence**: The application now remembers its window size and position on the screen between sessions.
-   **Manual Work Timer**: Added a manual stopwatch to each task to track active work time.
-   **Category Management**: Implemented a full category system with a manager in the sidebar to add, rename, and delete categories.
-   **Tabbed Task Filtering**: Added a tab bar to the "List View" to filter tasks by category, including counters for open tasks in each tab.
-   **Re-occurring Tasks**: Added a toggle to mark tasks as re-occurring, which automatically recreates them upon completion.
-   **Deadline Timers**: Enhanced the "Complete By" field to include a time, with a live "Time Left" countdown visible in the task header and details.
-   **Pay Rate & Cost Calculation**: Added a "Pay Rate" field to tasks to automatically calculate and display the total task cost based on time tracked.
-   **External Link Manager**: Added a section in the settings to manage a list of quick-access external website links, which are displayed in the main header.
-   **Custom Browser Selection**: Added a new settings section to define a list of browsers. Users can now cycle through the list with a hotkey (` ` `) and open links in the selected browser instead of the system default.
-   **View Persistence**: The application now remembers the last active view ("Meme View" or "List View") and restores it on startup.
-   **Data Persistence**: Replaced `localStorage` with `electron-store` for robust, file-based data persistence, following secure Electron patterns.
-   **Save State Management**: The application now tracks an "unsaved changes" (dirty) state, providing clear visual feedback to the user.
-   **Dynamic Save Button**: Implemented a single save button that dynamically changes its text and color (red for "Unsaved", green for "Saved") to reflect the current project state.
-   **`Control+S` Shortcut**: Added a keyboard shortcut for `Control+S` to quickly save the project.
-   **Smart Quit Dialog**: When closing the app with unsaved changes, a dialog now prompts the user to "Save and Quit", "Don't Save", or "Cancel". The app closes instantly if there are no unsaved changes.
-   **Accordion Management**: Added "Expand All" (üìÇ) and "Collapse All" (üìÅ) buttons to the list view for better task management.
-   **Autocomplete Tasks**: Implemented an "Autocomplete on Deadline" feature. Tasks with this enabled will automatically complete themselves when their deadline passes. This can be combined with "Re-occurring" for self-resetting timers.
-   **Quick Toggles**: Added icons to the task header in list view to quickly toggle "Re-occurring" (üîÅ) and "Autocomplete" (ü§ñ) status, with toast notifications for feedback.
-   **Configurable Deadline Warnings**: The "Time Left" countdown now turns yellow when a deadline is approaching. This warning time is now configurable in a new "Time Management" section in the sidebar (defaulting to 60 minutes).
-   **Enhanced UI Feedback**: Added confirmation dialogs for deleting sub-categories to prevent accidental data loss.
-   **Improved Task Creation**: When creating a new task from a sub-category view, the new task form now correctly pre-selects that sub-category.
-   **Consistent Sidebar**: The "Category Manager", "External Link Manager", and other settings accordions are now visible in both "Meme View" and "List View".

### Fixed
-   **Build System Overhaul**: Resolved a complex and persistent build loop involving conflicting TypeScript module configurations (`Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable` vs. `module is not defined`). The final solution involved renaming configuration files to `.cts` to enforce CommonJS module resolution, correcting `require` paths, and aligning all `@electron-forge` package versions in `package.json`. This stabilized the development environment and resolved the final `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` white screen issue.
-   **Data Integrity on Quit**: Fixed a critical race condition where clicking "Save and Quit" would close the application before the save operation completed, leading to data loss. The main process now takes full control of the save sequence during shutdown to guarantee data integrity.
-   **Word Placement on Save**: Fixed a bug where words added in "List View" would not appear on the "Meme View" canvas after relaunching. The save logic (for both the save button and the quit dialog) now ensures all words have valid canvas coordinates before being persisted.
-   **List View Input**: Fixed a bug that prevented adding new words by pressing "Enter" while in "List View".
-   **Canvas Redraw**: Fixed a bug where the background image would disappear when switching from "List View" back to "Meme View".
-   **UI/UX Improvements**: Refined the UI with consistent icons, non-intrusive toast notifications for user actions, and improved layout for the task list to be cleaner and more intuitive.
-   **Clickable Category Pills**: Added clickable category "pills" to task headers for quick navigation between category views.
-   **Hierarchical Category Pills**: Task headers now display both parent and child category pills (e.g., "Work" and "Tickets") for better context.
-   **Dynamic UI**: The UI now intelligently hides empty sections (like "Priority List" or "Completed Items") and provides helpful "Open Task" buttons to improve workflow.
-   **External Link Handling**: Fixed a bug where hyperlinks created in the description field would navigate inside the app instead of opening in the user's default browser.
-   **Context Menu Logic**: Resolved event propagation conflicts to ensure the correct context menu (for links vs. tickets) appears reliably.
-   **List Reordering**: Fixed a critical bug where the up/down arrows for reordering tasks in the list view would fail when filters were active. The logic now correctly reorders items based on their visual position on the screen.
